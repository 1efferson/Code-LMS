        git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
        cd code-lms
```

###  2. Setup Virtual Environment

   ```bash
        Setup Virtual Environment
        python -m venv venv
        # Activate the environment (Linux/macOS)
        source venv/bin/activate
        # Activate the environment (Windows)
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
   ```bash 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```


### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env and flaskenv file respectively in the root directory and add:
```bash 
   SECRET_KEY="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
  SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///site.db"
 
 ```
```bash 
   FLASK_APP=run.py
  FLASK_ENV=development
 
 ```

###  5. Initialize the Database using Flask-Migrate:

```bash 
 flask db upgrade

 ```
### 6. Run the Application
```bash 
 flask run

 ```

## üß© Architecture & Blueprints

The system is modular, using Flask Blueprints for clear separation of features.

### **main Blueprint**
Handles general pages and non-core routes.

| Route | Purpose | Access | Template |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|
| `/` | Homepage | Public | `home.html` |
| `/about` | Info about the LMS | Public | `about.html` |
| `/dashboard` | User dashboard | Logged In | `dashboard.html` |

---

### **auth Blueprint**
Manages authentication and session handling via Flask-Login.

| Route | Purpose | Access | Template |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|
| `/register` | User registration | Public | `auth/register.html` |
| `/login` | User login | Public | `auth/login.html` |
| `/logout` | Logout and redirect | Logged In | Redirects |

---

### **courses Blueprint**
Handles the core course logic ‚Äî catalog, enrollment, and lessons.

| Route | Purpose | Access | Template |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|
| `/courses` | Course catalog | Public | `courses/course_catalog.html` |
| `/enroll/<slug>` | Enroll user in course | Logged In (POST) | Redirect to first lesson |
| `/<course_slug>/<lesson_slug>` | Lesson viewer | Enrolled users | `courses/course_lesson.html` |

---

## üß± Database Models

The app uses SQLAlchemy ORM to manage relationships between entities.

| Model | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **User** | Stores user credentials and integrates with Flask-Login |
| **Course** | Contains metadata like title, slug, level, and description |
| **Module** | Organizes lessons within a course (e.g., ‚ÄúIntroduction to Python‚Äù) |
| **Lesson** | The core content unit ‚Äî includes title, slug, and video embed URL |
| **Enrollment** | Many-to-many relationship linking Users and Courses |
| **Progress (In progress)** | Tracks lesson completion for each user |



## Roadmap
   **Add progress tracking and completion certificates**
    
   **Build an admin dashboard for instructors**
    
   **Add comments/discussions to lessons**
    
   **Analytics dashboard for student performance**
